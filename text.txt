Modern CPUs (Central Processing Units) are designed to execute billions of operations per second. Mohsen
A typical processor, like the Intel Core-i7 12700K released in 2021, contains 12 cores and 20 threads, running at a base clock of 3.6 GHz and boosting up to 5.0 GHz.
Another example is AMD’s Ryzen 5 5600X, which has 6 cores, 12 threads, and a 32 MB L3 cache.

Inside every CPU, the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) performs basic mathematical operations, while the CU (Control Unit) decides when each instruction should run. Together, they process instructions stored in memory.
Many CPUs support instruction sets such as x86, x86-64, and ARMv8, allowing the same program to run on different hardware architectures.

Some server-grade CPUs, such as the Xeon-Gold 6326 or EPYC-7742, handle extremely large workloads. These processors may contain 48, 64, or even 128 cores.
Mobile CPUs, like the Snapdragon 8-Gen-2, focus on power efficiency, using big cores and small cores to balance performance and battery life. MoHsen

In text processing tasks, CPUs often use techniques like SIMD (Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data) to speed up operations such as searching strings, comparing characters, sorting words, and scanning logs.
For example, scanning a 100-MB log file for the word “error” might take only a few milliseconds on a modern CPU. mohsen
